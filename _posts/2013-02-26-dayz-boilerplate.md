I've started playing DayZ, and have been working through building a quick web app for marking up a
map for use with that game using the Google Maps API (v3.) It's going pretty well, and hopefully
I'll finish up that project in the next few weeks and release it.

Second, I had my hand in getting the [iMarc Boilerplate](https://github.com/imarc/boilerplate)
released on GitHub, so there's that. I'll have to update the markup and CSS for this to be in sync
with the Boilerplate, as it is a great starting point.
