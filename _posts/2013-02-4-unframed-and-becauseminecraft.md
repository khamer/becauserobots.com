Fairly busy weekend for me: I released [Unframed](https://github.com/khamer/unframed), a chrome extension for looking at the page structure and classnames, and [BecauseMinecraft](https://github.com/khamer/BecauseMinecraft), a dirt simple GUI-less Minecraft launcher for windows only. Feel free to check both out.
