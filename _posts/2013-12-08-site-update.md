### DayZ, Boilerplate, Raphaeljs

Nothing too ridiculous to report. I've  done another site reskin, one that I like a bit more than the last one. The only
part I'm not sure about yet is whether Signika is here to stay. I like is strong style - reminds me a bit of PT Mono.
Especially on M, K, k, C, and c. My biggest complaint about the typeface right now is I've never really liked lowercase
numbers like the ones in this set.

Other than that, the site is now based on Boilerplate 1.1, which is fair bit cleaner, and I'm resurrecting my DayZ
project, and hope to make some progress on that in the next few weeks.
