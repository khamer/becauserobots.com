So, I'm slowly making progress. I have taken a few more steps to improving this
workflow, but overall, I'm still skeptical. I may yet move this site to my VPS
and setup Jekyll there. I've also started to look at OctoPress another other
engines again, as I'm starting to realize how many 'rough spots' there are.

In particular, you may notice that tagging is broken. Anyway, we shall see.
