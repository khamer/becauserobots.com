I hosted my site on [Tumblr](http://khamer.tumblr.com) for the past couple
years. Before that, I was using Posterous (which I liked more, but lacked the
ability just enough customizability to annoy me.) Before that, WordPress, which
I still find myself using for odd quick projects for friends. Before that, I
tried a little of everything: TiddlyWiki, Trac, Textform, Drupal, Twiki, wikka,
MediaWiki, even phpBB.

However, this iteration of BecauseRobots is built on top of of Jekyll and
GitHub Pages. I did try out Octopress and Jekyll Bootstrap, but I've chosen to
roll my own on top of Jekyll as I go.

So, please bare with me as I rebuild the site.
