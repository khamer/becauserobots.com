title: About Kevin Hamer

I am Kevin Hamer and I am a lead web engineer at **iMarc** in Newburyport,
Massachusetts. I run vim and XFCE (Xubuntu) on a Lenovo X1 Carbon these days. I prefer mercurial to git or subversion, but unfortunately GitHub has far more mindshare than BitBucket.

when I'm not being productive, I'm often in [/r/mechanicalkeyboards](https://reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards). I own four mechanical and three unusual form factor keyboards at the moment:

* two Leopold FC-200RL/AB Tenkeyless keyboards with mechanical Cherry MX Black switches,
* an IBM Model M2 Keyboard from 1993,
* a Silicon Graphics keyboard that, unfortunately, won't work with modern computers,
* a HHKB Lite 2 with rubber dome switches, and
* both the Typematrix 2020 and Typematrix 2030 keyboards, although the 2020
  doesn't work properly.

These days I've also become very distracted with DayZ, a zombie survival game.

And, when I'm not doing that, I like to playing Minecraft with friends. Sometimes I also run a server, but at the moment I mostly play on [Project M](http://www.projectmserver.com/), a SMP server one of my friends runs.
