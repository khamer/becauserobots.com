		<p>
			My name is Kevin Hamer and I am a lead web engineer at <a href="http://www.imarc.net">iMarc</a>
			in Newburyport. iMarc was founded in 1997 and has added a new wing and a second office
			while I've been there. It's a great atmosphere, and we like to really think things
			through, making sure every component of our projects have the same vision, goals, and
			direction.
		</p>

		<p>
			I have a nice Lenovo X1 Carbon I use. I run GVIM and XFCE mostly, though I try to switch
			over and test out other things like Sublime Text's vintage mode, Gnome 3, and Unity
			occasionally. I prefer mercurial, but iMarc uses Subversion and Git seems unavoidable.
		</p>

		<p>
			Besides the client projects I work on over there, my biggest open source project is
			<a href="http://imarc.github.io/boilerplate/">Boilerplate</a>, our alternative to using
			Twitter Bootstrap or such.

			When I play
		</div>
		<p>
			When I'm not being productive, I am often in
			<a href="https://reddit.com/r/mechanicalkeyboards">/r/mechanicalkeyboards</a>.
			I own four mechanical and three unusual form factor keyboards at the moment:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>two Leopold FC-200RL/AB Tenkeyless keyboards with mechanical Cherry MX Black switches,</li>
			<li>an IBM Model M2 Keyboard from 1993,</li>
			<li>a Silicon Graphics keyboard that, unfortunately, won't work with modern computers,</li>
			<li>a HHKB Lite 2 with rubber dome switches, and</li>
			<li>both the Typematrix 2020 and Typematrix 2030 keyboards, although the 2020 doesn't work properly.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			These days I've also become distracted with DayZ with a group known as Turkey Bravo
			(TKB), a zombie survival game. I'm also prone to spending time playing Kerbal Space
			Program, an exceptional indie game.
		</p>

		<p>
			I still occasionally playing Minecraft as well, but between avoiding zombies and working my way to
			Jop, I keep myself entertained.
